# Platformer002 - Gravity and AABB Collision Detection

This tutorial builds on Platformer001 and adds gravity when jumping and collision detection (the sprite colliding against the floor when landing from a jump)

You don't need to have completed Platformer001 to follow this tutorial but if you are not familiar with spritesheet animations or basic movement via the keyboard in MonoGame have a look at Platformer001 as it goes into more detail on these topics.
